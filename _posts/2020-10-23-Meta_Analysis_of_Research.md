**Topic:** Artificial Inteligence and Machine Learning  
**Paper:** [Emergent Tool Use From Multi-Agent Autocurricula](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07528.pdf)
**Question**
The team of computer scientists from OpenAI and Google Brain that wrote this paper were attempting to determine if when a machine learning algorithmsimple is applied to a relativly simple multi agent competative game complex behaviors can emerge. The researchers also wanted to examine how as the agents improved their skill competing with one another, how the agents would change the enviornment for their oponets. For this study the computer scientists built a modified team-based game of hide and seek and ran a machine learning algorithm through tens of millions of iterations. They then drew data from the number of rewards each team of agents recieves, the movement of different objects in the game, the agent's movement, and how quickly different behaviors emerged from the agents different learning methods are applied.  
**Trust in Findings**
I am inclined to believe this study
