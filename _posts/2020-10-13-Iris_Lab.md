**Results**
1. Species with longest pedals on average: Iris Virginica
2. Species with widest sepals on average: Iris Setosa  

**Method**  

To complete this lab I began by modifying my code from the reading files homework to make the code more generalized so I could read in multiple fields from the iris.csv file. I then built a method to average all the values corresponding each key in a dict. I used these two methods together to get a dict where each key corresponded to an average value for a specific species. I then built a method to take this simplified averaged dict and output the key that contained the largest averaged value. After running all these methods for both the fields we were asked to find the largest average species for I printed the result. This lab was an important lesson in ensuring to make my code more repurpasable and generalized in different methods as it would have been easier to complete this lab if I did not need to modify the code I had already written for my homework. I did not work with anyone for this project and my only source was [UCI Machine Learning Repository's Iris Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).
