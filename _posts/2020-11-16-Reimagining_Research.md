**Study Title:** [Emergent Tool Use From Multi-Agent Autocurricula](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07528.pdf)  
After looking into the credibility of this paper in my Meta Analysis of Research post, I would like to examine possible future studies assuming that the model of multi-agent competative learning they describe in their paper is truley effective. In addition, considering my group's role in my Software Engineering class this study, while likley immensely impractical for a high school student to implement, brings up some interesting ideas as to how a computer can be taught to beat a competitive game.
