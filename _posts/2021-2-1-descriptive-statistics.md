**Dataset Chosen:** Country Vaccinations  

**Analysis:**  
For this lab I chose to analize how many vaccines countries have adminstered by 1/24/21 and the trends in how many vaccines have been delivered per day.  

Frequency of Number of Vaccines Administered by 1/24/21 by 60 Countries:

This variable proved to be highly variable with a range of 161492900. The mean number of total vacciens delivered was 1211611 but this data was heavily skewed left as can be seen in the violin plot below.
The IQR of this data is 676753.75 making any values above 1402936.3 potential outliers. Overall, when looked at in the form of a table this data clearly shows that some countries are using significantly
more vaccines than others.
